The ServiceNow platform provides the following options for asset discovery.\nThe separate, robust Discovery tool.\nFor organizations that want to use the discovery technologies they have deployed already, such as SMS, Tally NetCensus, LanDesk, or others, ServiceNow can support integration to those technologies via web services. Scanned data can be mapped directly into the Configuration Management Database (CMDB).\nClean up information in the CMDB. Remove information that is obsolete or invalid. Ensure that all remaining information is accurate and complete. Add any necessary information.\nCreate categories of asset models such as computers, servers, printers, and software.\nCreate asset models. Models are specific versions or various configurations of an asset, such as a MacBook Pro 17\".\nCreate individual assets, such as hardware, consumables, and software licenses. If you used a discovery tool, you may already have many assets identified accurately.\nManage assets by counting software licenses, viewing assets that are in stock, setting asset states and substates, and analyzing unallocated software.",

Such functionality includes the ability to perform create, read, update, and delete (CRUD) operations on existing tables (Table API), insert data into, retrieve information from, and run transforms against a MetricBase database (MetricBase Time Series API, and many others.\n\nFor a list of available REST APIs, see REST API reference.\n\nREST URI format and available parameters\nServiceNow REST APIs follow standard REST API protocol.

    "heading5": "Scripted REST APIs",
    "content5": "The scripted REST API feature allows application developers to build custom web service APIs.\n\nYou can define service endpoints, query parameters, and headers for a scripted REST API, as well as scripts to manage the request and response.\n\nScripted REST APIs generally follow the REST architecture, but you can customize them to use different conventions. You define scripted REST APIs using the Scripted REST Service form found under Scripted Web Services ? Scripted REST APIs.\n\nScripted REST Service form\nScripted REST Service form\nThe following podcast offers additional information on the use of scripted REST APIs.\n\n\nScripted REST API URIs\nScripted REST API URIs have the following format:\nhttps://<instance.service-now.com>/api/<name_space>/<version>/<api_id>/<relative_path>\nIn this URI:\n<instance.service-now.com>: Path to the ServiceNow instance where users access the scripted REST API.\n<name_space>: For web services in the global scope, the name space is the value of the property glide.appcreator.company.code. For web services in a scoped application, the name space is the scope name, such as x_company_appname. For additional information on name spaces, see Application scope.\n<version>: Optional. Version of the endpoint to access if the API uses versioning, such as v1. You can access the default version of a versioned API by specifying the URI without a version number.\n<api_id>: Value of the API ID field on the Scripted REST Service form. By default this value is based on the service name.\n<relative_path>: Relative path defined for the resource in the Scripted REST Service form. Specifying a relative resource path allows you to have multiple resources using the same HTTP method, such as GET, in one web service. For example, a resource may specify the path /{id} when the web service has only one GET resource, or /user/{id} and /message/{id} when the web service has different resources for requesting user and message records.\nScripted REST API versioning\nScripted REST API URIs may include a version number, such as /api/management/v1/table/{tableName}. Version numbers identify the endpoint version that a URI accesses. By specifying a version number in your URIs, you can test and deploy changes without impacting existing integrations.\n\nDefault API version\nA version may be marked as default. Specifying a default version allows users to access that version using a scripted REST endpoint without a version number. If no version is marked as default, the latest version is used as the default.\n\nScripted REST API resources\nA scripted REST API resource is equivalent to a REST endpoint. It defines the HTTP method to execute, the processing script, and any override settings from the parent API. You can define one ore more resources per API.\n\nScripted REST API query parameters\nQuery parameters define values that requesting users can pass in a request. When creating a scripted REST API, you can specify which parameters are available and which are mandatory for each request. You can also associate a query parameter with multiple resources.\n\nAccess request parameters in scripts using the request object queryParams field.\n\nScripted REST API roles\nTo work with scripted REST APIs, you must have the web service administrator [web_service_admin] role. Users with this role can read, create, modify, and delete scripted REST APIs and web service resources.\nNote: These roles are not required to access a scripted REST API endpoint.\nRequest and response formats\nBy default, all resources in an API support the following request and response formats: application/json, application/xml, and text/xml. You can overrride the default formats at the API level. The new formats apply to all resources belonging to the API, unless an individual resource overrides the defaults.\n\nScripted REST API security\nYou can configure your scripted REST APIs with the necessary level of security. From public APIs/endpoints that don't require any security to highly secure APIs/endpoints that require user authentication with tight access control to all resources.\n\nScripted REST API access controls\nAccess control lists (ACLs) define criteria, such as the roles needed and conditions that a user must meet to access a scripted REST API or endpoint. A requesting user must satisfy at least one of the ACLs. It is not necessary to satisfy all selected ACLs. You can define a single ACL for an entire REST API or for an individual endpoint.\n\nNote: By default, scripted REST APIs contain an ACL that prohibits users with the snc_external role from making requests to the API.\nWhen defining a scripted REST API ACL, it must have the Type value REST_Endpoint.\n\nFor additional information on ACLs, see Access control list rules and Configure a scripted REST API resource to require an ACL.\n\nScripted REST API security matrix\nThere are multiple possible security configurations for scripted REST APIs. Use this table to identify the scripted REST API security configuration that best suits your needs, and the field values to implement that configuration.",
